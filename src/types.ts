 * Shared primitive types used across DEAD SIGNAL: EXCLUSION ZONE.

 * World conventions (everything in the project follows these):
 *  - Units are metres. +Y is up. +X is east, +Z is south, so -Z is NORTH.
 *  - Yaw 0 looks toward -Z (north). Positive yaw turns counter-clockwise (toward -X, west).
 *    Forward vector for a yaw angle: (-sin(yaw), 0, -cos(yaw)).
 *  - Ground is flat at y = 0.
