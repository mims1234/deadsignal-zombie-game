/**
 * First-person viewmodel contract. The game owns weapon STATE (ammo, reload timing, ADS blend, switching); the
 * rigs own all VISUAL animation derived from a `ViewmodelPose` that the game passes in every frame.
 *
 * Rendering setup (owned by the game): a separate `viewScene` rendered after the world with the depth buffer cleared,
 * using `PerspectiveCamera(fov = 52 (vertical) at 16:9, near = 0.02, far = 6)` positioned at the origin looking down -Z
 * (+X right, +Y up). Rigs are children of that scene and are positioned around the origin: the weapon's grip is
 * roughly at (0.14 .. 0.2, -0.22 .. -0.16, -0.35 .. -0.28) and the gloved forearms come up from below the screen edge.
 * The game supplies hemisphere + directional + point-light lighting and `scene.environment` reflections.
 * All geometry must be small-scale (metres) and must never intersect the near plane in any pose.
