/**
 * Zombie visual rig contract. The game owns AI, movement and hit resolution; a rig owns the model and procedural
 * (skeletal / hierarchical) animation. The rig's root is placed at the zombie's FEET; the model faces local -Z
 * (forward = (-sin yaw, 0, -cos yaw) for `root.rotation.y = yaw`), matching the camera convention.
 *
 * Performance budget: up to ~40 rigs alive at once, so each rig should cost O(1) draw calls (a single SkinnedMesh with a
 * shared material is ideal; avoid dozens of separate Meshes per zombie) and allocate nothing in `update`.
